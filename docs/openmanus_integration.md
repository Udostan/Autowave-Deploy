# OpenManus Integration for Prime Agent

This document provides an overview of the OpenManus integration with the Prime Agent platform.

## Overview

OpenManus is an open-source initiative to replicate the capabilities of the Manus AI agent, a state-of-the-art general-purpose AI developed by Monica. The integration allows Prime Agent users to access OpenManus capabilities directly from the Prime Agent interface.

## Features

- **Task Execution**: Submit tasks to OpenManus for autonomous execution
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor task execution progress in real-time
- **Results Display**: View comprehensive results with Markdown formatting
- **Tool Integration**: Access to OpenManus tools like web browsing, code execution, and file operations

## Implementation Details

The OpenManus integration consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend UI**: A dedicated tab in the Prime Agent interface for interacting with OpenManus
2. **Backend API**: Flask routes for communicating with the OpenManus backend
3. **JavaScript Client**: Client-side code for handling user interactions and displaying results

## Usage

1. Navigate to the OpenManus tab in the Prime Agent interface
2. Enter a task description in the input field
3. Click "Execute Task" to submit the task to OpenManus
4. Monitor the execution progress in the left panel
5. View the results in the right panel when the task is complete

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/openmanus/execute`: Submit a task to OpenManus
- `GET /api/openmanus/status/<task_id>`: Check the status of a task
- `GET /api/openmanus/tools`: Get a list of available tools

## Configuration

The OpenManus integration can be configured through environment variables:

- `OPENMANUS_API_URL`: URL of the OpenManus API server (default: http://localhost:8000)

## Future Enhancements

- Full integration with the henryalps/OpenManus backend
- Support for more advanced OpenManus features
- Enhanced UI with more detailed progress tracking
- Integration with Prime Agent's existing tools and capabilities
